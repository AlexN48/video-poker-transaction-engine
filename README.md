# Video Poker Transaction Engine (Java)

Deterministic Java transaction engine modeling bet authorization, rule validation,
state transitions, payout calculation, and balance reconciliation using reproducible
hand injection for testing.

## What This Demonstrates
- Deterministic rule evaluation
- Transaction debit / credit flows
- State-machine based gameplay transitions
- Balance integrity enforcement
- Structured payout calculation
- Seeded and injected test-hand constructor for reproducible validation

## Why This Matters
This project models the same primitives used in financial transaction routing
systems such as authorization, validation, state transitions, and settlement logic.
